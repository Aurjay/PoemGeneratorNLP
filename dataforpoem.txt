Let the bird of loudest lay\nOn the sole Arabian tree\nHerald sad and trumpet be,\nTo whose sound chaste wings obey.\nBut thou shrieking harbinger,\nFoul precurrer of the fiend,\nAugur of the fever\'s

compounded;\nThat it cried, "How true a twain\nSeemeth this concordant one!\nLove has reason, reason none,\nIf what parts can so remain."\nWhereupon it made this threne\nTo the Phoenix and the Dove,\nCo-supremes and stars of love,\nAs chorus to their tragic scene:\n                 threnos\nBeauty, truth, and rarity,\nGrace in all simplicity,\nHere enclos\'d, in cinders lie.\nDeath is now the Phoenix\' nest,\nAnd the Turtle\'s loyal breast\nTo eternity doth rest,\nLeaving no posterity:\n\'Twas not their infirmity,\nIt was married chastity.\nTruth may seem but cannot be;\nBeauty brag but \'tis not she;\nTruth and beauty buried be.\nTo this urn let those repair\nThat are either true or fair;\nFor these dead birds sigh a prayer.', "Sir Charles into my chamber coming in,\nWhen I was

thereof did verses frame,\nWith which and other spelles like terrible,\nHe bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,\nAnd cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame\nOf highest God, the Lord of life and

quake,\nAnd lifting up his lumpish head, with blame\nHalfe angry asked him, for what he came.\nHither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,\nHe that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,\nHe bids thee to him

opposite two cities stood,\nSea-borderers, disjoin\'d by Neptune\'s might;\nThe one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.\nAt Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,\nWhom young Apollo courted for her hair,\nAnd offer\'d as a dower his burning throne,\nWhere she could sit for men to gaze upon.\nThe outside of her garments were of lawn,\nThe lining purple silk, with gilt stars drawn;\nHer wide sleeves green, and border\'d with a grove,\nWhere Venus in her naked glory strove\nTo please the careless and disdainful eyes\nOf proud Adonis, that before her lies;\nHer kirtle blue, whereon was many a stain,\nMade with the blood of wretched lovers slain.\nUpon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,\nFrom whence her veil reach\'d to the ground beneath;\nHer veil was artificial flowers and leaves,\nWhose workmanship both man and beast deceives;\nMany would praise the sweet smell as she past,\nWhen \'twas the odour which her breath forth cast;\nAnd there for honey bees have sought in vain,\nAnd beat from thence, have lighted there again.\nAbout her neck hung chains of pebble-stone,\nWhich lighten\'d by her neck, like diamonds shone.\nShe ware no gloves; for neither sun nor wind\nWould burn or parch her hands, but, to her mind,\nOr warm or cool them, for they took delight\nTo play upon those hands, they were so white.\nBuskins of shells, all silver\'d, used she,\nAnd branch\'d with blushing coral to the knee;\nWhere sparrows perch\'d, of hollow pearl and gold,\nSuch as the world would wonder to behold:\nThose with sweet water oft her handmaid fills,\nWhich as she went, would chirrup through the bills.\nSome say, for her the fairest Cupid pin\'d,\nAnd looking in her face, was strooken blind.\nBut this is true; so like was one the other,\nAs he imagin\'d Hero was his mother;\nAnd oftentimes into her bosom flew,\nAbout her naked neck his bare arms threw,\nAnd laid his childish head upon her breast,\nAnd with still panting rock\'d there took his rest.\nSo lovely-fair was Hero, Venus\' nun,\nAs Nature wept, thinking she was undone,\nBecause she took more from her than she left,\nAnd of such wondrous beauty her bereft:\nTherefore, in sign her treasure suffer\'d wrack,\nSince Hero\'s time hath half the world been black.\n         Amorous Leander, beautiful and young\n(Whose tragedy divine Musus sung),\nDwelt at Abydos; since him dwelt there none\nFor whom succeeding times make greater moan.\nHis dangling tresses, that were never shorn,\nHad they been cut, and unto Colchos borne,\nWould have allur\'d the vent\'rous youth of Greece\nTo hazard more than for the golden fleece.\nFair Cynthia wish\'d his arms might be her sphere;\nGrief makes her pale, because she moves not there.\nHis body was as straight as Circe\'s wand;\nJove might have sipt out nectar from his hand.\nEven as delicious meat is to the taste,\nSo was his neck in touching, and surpast\nThe white of Pelops\' shoulder: I could tell ye,\nHow smooth his breast was, and how white his belly;\nAnd whose immortal fingers did imprint\nThat heavenly path with many a curious dint\nThat runs along his back; but my rude pen\nCan hardly blazon forth the loves of men,\nMuch less of powerful gods: let it suffice\nThat my slack Muse sings of Leander\'s eyes;\nThose orient cheeks and lips, exceeding his\nThat leapt into the water for a kiss\nOf his own shadow, and, despising many,\nDied ere he could enjoy the love of any.\nHad wild Hippolytus Leander seen,\nEnamour\'d of his beauty had he been.\nHis presence made the rudest peasant melt,\nThat in the vast uplandish country dwelt;\nThe barbarous Thracian soldier, mov\'d with nought,\nWas mov\'d with him, and for his favour sought.\nSome swore he was a maid in man\'s attire,\nFor in his looks were all that men desire,\nA pleasant smiling cheek, a speaking eye,\nA brow for love to banquet royally;\nAnd such as knew he was a man, would say,\n"Leander, thou art made for amorous play;\nWhy art thou not in love, and lov\'d of all?\nThough thou be fair, yet be not thine own thrall."\n         The men of wealthy Sestos every year,\nFor his sake whom their goddess held so dear,\nRose-cheek\'d Adonis, kept a solemn feast.\nThither resorted many a wandering guest\nTo meet their loves; such as had none at all\nCame lovers home from this great festival;\nFor every street, like to a firmament,\nGlister\'d with breathing stars, who, where they went,\nFrighted the melancholy earth, which deem\'d\nEternal heaven to burn, for so it seem\'d\nAs if another Pha{"e}ton had got\nThe guidance of the sun\'s rich chariot.\nBut far above the loveliest, Hero shin\'d,\nAnd stole away th\' enchanted gazer\'s mind;\nFor like sea-nymphs\' inveigling harmony,\nSo was her beauty to the standers-by;\nNor that night-wandering, pale, and watery star\n(When yawning dragons draw her thirling car\nFrom Latmus\' mount up to the gloomy sky,\nWhere, crown\'d with blazing light and majesty,\nShe proudly sits) more over-rules the flood\nThan she the hearts of those that near her stood.\nEven as when gaudy nymphs pursue the chase,\nWretched Ixion\'s shaggy-footed race,\nIncens\'d with savage heat, gallop amain\nFrom steep pine-bearing mountains to the plain,\nSo ran the people forth to gaze upon her,\nAnd all that view\'d her were enamour\'d on her.\nAnd as in fury of a dreadful fight,\nTheir fellows being slain or put to flight,\nPoor soldiers stand with fear of death dead-strooken,\nSo at her presence all surpris\'d and tooken,\nAwait the sentence of her scornful eyes;\nHe whom she favours lives; the other dies.\nThere might you see one sigh, another rage,\nAnd some, their violent passions to assuage,\nCompile sharp satires; but, alas, too late,\nFor faithful love will never turn to hate.\nAnd many, seeing great princes were denied,\nPin\'d as they went, and thinking on her, died.\nOn this feast-dayO cursed day and hour!\nWent Hero thorough Sestos, from her tower\nTo Venus\' temple, where unhappily,\nAs after chanc\'d, they did each other spy.\nSo fair a church as this had Venus none:\nThe walls were of discolour\'d jasper-stone,\nWherein was Proteus carved; and over-head\nA lively vine of green sea-agate spread,\nWhere by one hand light-headed Bacchus hung,\nAnd with the other wine from grapes out-wrung.\nOf crystal shining fair the pavement was;\nThe town of Sestos call\'d it Venus\' glass:\nThere might you see the gods in sundry shapes,\nCommitting heady riots, incest, rapes:\nFor know, that underneath this radiant flower\nWas Danae\'s statue in a brazen tower,\nJove slyly stealing from his sister\'s bed,\nTo dally with Idalian Ganimed,\nAnd for his love Europa bellowing loud,\nAnd tumbling with the rainbow in a cloud;\nBlood-quaffing Mars heaving the iron net,\nWhich limping Vulcan and his Cyclops set;\nLove kindling fire, to burn such towns as Troy,\nSylvanus weeping for the lovely boy\nThat now is turn\'d into a cypress tree,\nUnder whose shade the wood-gods love to be.\nAnd in the midst a silver altar stood:\nThere Hero, sacrificing turtles\' blood,\nVail\'d to the ground, veiling her eyelids close;\nAnd modestly they opened as she rose.\nThence flew Love\'s arrow with the golden head;\nAnd thus Leander was enamoured.\nStone-still he stood, and evermore he gazed,\nTill with the fire that from his count\'nance blazed\nRelenting Hero\'s gentle heart was strook:\nSuch force and virtue hath an amorous look.\n         It lies not in our power to love or hate,\nFor will in us is over-rul\'d by fate.\nWhen two are stript, long ere the course begin,\nWe wish that one should lose, the other win;\nAnd one especially do we affect\nOf two gold ingots, like in each respect:\nThe reason no man knows, let it suffice,\nWhat we behold is censur\'d by our eyes.\nWhere both deliberate, the love is slight:\nWho ever lov\'d, that lov\'d not at first sight?', 'By that he ended had his ghostly sermon,\nThe fox was well induc\'d to be a parson,\nAnd of the priest eftsoons gan to inquire,\nHow to a benefice he might aspire.\n"Marry, there" (said the priest) "is art indeed:\nMuch good deep learning one thereout may read;\nFor that the ground-work is, and end of all,\nHow to obtain a beneficial.\nFirst, therefore, when ye have in handsome wise\nYourself attired, as you can devise,\nThen to some nobleman yourself apply,\nOr other great one in the worldes eye,\nThat hath a zealous disposition\nTo God, and so to his religion.\nThere must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,\nSuch as no carpers may contrare reveal;\nFor each thing feigned ought more wary be.\nThere thou must walk in sober gravity,\nAnd seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:\nFast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,\nAnd unto every one do courtesy meek:\nThese looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,\nBut be thou sure one not to lack or long.\nAnd if thee list unto the court to throng,\nAnd there to hunt after the hoped prey,\nThen must thou thee dispose another way:\nFor there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie,\nTo face, to forge, to scoff, to company,\nTo crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock\nOf thy great master\'s will, to scorn, or mock.\nSo may\'st thou chance mock out a benefice,\nUnless thou canst one conjure by device,\nOr cast a figure for a bishopric;\nAnd if one could, it were but a school trick.\nThese be the ways by which without reward\nLivings in court be gotten, though full hard;\nFor nothing there is done without a fee:\nThe courtier needs must recompensed be\nWith a benevolence, or have in gage\nThe primitias of your parsonage:\nScarce can a bishopric forpass them by,\nBut that it must be gelt in privity.\nDo not thou therefore seek a living there,\nBut of more private persons seek elsewhere,\nWhereas thou may\'st compound a better penny,\nNe let thy learning question\'d be of any.\nFor some good gentleman, that hath the right\nUnto his church for to present a wight,\nWill cope with thee in reasonable wise;\nThat if the living yearly do arise\nTo forty pound, that then his youngest son\nShall twenty have, and twenty thou hast won:\nThou hast it won, for it is of frank gift,\nAnd he will care for all the rest to shift,\nBoth that the bishop may admit of thee,\nAnd that therein thou may\'st maintained be.\nThis is the way for one that is unlearn\'d\nLiving to get, and not to be discern\'d.\nBut they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,\nFor learning sake to living them to raise;\nYet many eke of them (God wot) are driven\nT\' accept a benefice in pieces riven.\nHow say\'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst\nUpon this common-place (though plain, not worst)?\nBetter a short tale than a bad long shriving.\nNeeds any more to learn to get a living?"\n"Now sure, and by my halidom," (quoth he)\n"Ye a great master are in your degree:\nGreat thanks I yield you for your discipline,\nAnd do not doubt but duly to incline\nMy wits thereto, as ye shall shortly hear."\nThe priest him wish\'d good speed, and well to fare:\nSo parted they, as either\'s way them led.\nBut th\' ape and fox ere long so well them sped,\nThrough the priest\'s wholesome counsel lately taught,\nAnd through their own fair handling wisely wrought,\nThat they a benefice \'twixt them obtained;\nAnd crafty Reynold was a priest ordained,\nAnd th\' ape his parish clerk procur\'d to be.\nThen made they revel rout and goodly glee;\nBut, ere long time had passed, they so ill\nDid order their affairs, that th\' evil will\nOf all their parish\'ners they had constrain\'d;\nWho to the Ordinary of them complain\'d,\nHow foully they their offices abus\'d,\nAnd them of crimes and heresies accus\'d,\nThat pursuivants he often for them sent;\nBut they neglected his commandement.\nSo long persisted obstinate and bold,\nTill at the length he published to hold\nA visitation, and them cited thether:\nThen was high time their wits about to geather.\nWhat did they then, but made a composition\nWith their next neighbour priest, for light condition,\nTo whom their living they resigned quite\nFor a few pence, and ran away by night.', "CALM was the day, and through the trembling air\nSweet breathing Zephyrus did softly play,\nA gentle spirit, that lightly did delay\nHot Titan's beams, which then did glister fair;\nWhen I whose sullen care,\nThrough discontent of my long fruitless stay\nIn prince's court, and expectation vain\nOf idle hopes, which still do fly away\nLike empty shadows, did afflict my brain,\nWalked forth to ease my pain\nAlong the shore of silver streaming Thames,\nWhose rutty bank, the which his river hems,\nWas painted all with variable flowers,\nAnd all the meads adorned with dainty gems,\nFit to deck maidens' bowers,\nAnd crown their paramours,\nAgainst the bridal day, which is not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\nThere, in a meadow, by the river's side,\nA flock of nymphs I chanced to espy,\nAll lovely daughters of the flood thereby,\nWith goodly greenish locks, all loose untied,\nAs each had been a bride;\nAnd each one had a little wicker basket,\nMade of fine twigs, entrailed curiously,\nIn which they gathered flowers to fill their flasket,\nAnd with fine fingers cropt full featously\nThe tender stalks on high.\nOf every sort, which in that meadow grew,\nThey gathered some; the violet pallid blue,\nThe little daisy, that at evening closes,\nThe virgin lily, and the primrose true,\nWith store of vermeil roses,\nTo deck their bridegrooms' posies\nAgainst the bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\nWith that, I saw two swans of goodly hue\nCome softly swimming down along the Lee;\nTwo fairer birds I yet did never see.\nThe snow which doth the top of Pindus strew,\nDid never whiter shew,\nNor Jove himself, when he a swan would be\nFor love of Leda, whiter did appear:\nYet Leda was they say as white as he,\nYet not so white as these, nor nothing near.\nSo purely white they were,\nThat even the gentle stream, the which them bare,\nSeemed foul to them, and bade his billows spare\nTo wet their silken feathers, lest they might\nSoil their fair plumes with water not so fair,\nAnd mar their beauties bright,\nThat shone as heaven's light,\nAgainst their bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.\nEftsoons the nymphs, which now had flowers their fill,\nRan all in haste, to see that silver brood,\nAs they came floating on the crystal flood.\nWhom when they saw, they stood amazed still,\nTheir wondering eyes to fill.\nThem seemed they never saw a sight so fair,\nOf fowls so lovely, that they sure did deem\nThem heavenly born, or to be that same pair\nWhich through the sky draw Venus' silver team;\nFor sure they did not seem\nTo be begot of any earthly seed,\nBut rather angels, or of angels' breed:\nYet were they bred of Somers-heat they say,\nIn sweetest season, when each flower and weed\nThe earth did fresh array,\nSo fresh they seemed as day,\nEven as their bridal day, which was not long:\n      Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.
